# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to the loose equality operator (==).  The bug arises from the way JavaScript performs type coercion during comparisons.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version, emphasizing the use of strict equality (===).
